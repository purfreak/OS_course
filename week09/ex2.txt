To decrease hit rate we should refer to page not existing in page frames.
To increase hit rate we need to refer to pages already existing in frames.


Let us consider 3 frames, 1 page per tick:
  Max hits: 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3... (all the referred pages exist in page frame)
  Min hits: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... (there are no referred pages in page frame at any time)
