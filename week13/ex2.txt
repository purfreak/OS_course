We should use:
recovery through Preemption if it's possible to temporarily take a resource away from its current owner and give it to another process,
recovery through Rollback if we can use "checkpoints" to restart processes at the specified points when it's needed,
recovery through Killing Processes if it's possible to carefully kill processes that is holding needed resources,
avoidance strategy if the system is be able to decide whether granting a resource is safe or not,
prevention strategy if we can't do anything of listed above.
