Here is everything that is on my laptop in /usr/bin (as you can see, there is nothing containing gcc):

.		csh		expr		ls		rmdir		unlink
..		dash		hostname	mkdir		sh		wait4path
[		date		kill		mv		sleep		zsh
bash		dd		ksh		pax		stty
cat		df		launchctl	ps		sync
chmod		echo		link		pwd		tcsh
cp		ed		ln		rm		test
